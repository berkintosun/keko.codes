                <p>You imagine the new big web app? Good, but you need to design the interface and the database structure, code the frontend and the backend. OH, don't forget about the security and devops!</p>
                <p>Or a fancy machine learning solution? Nice one! But how are you planning to collect the dataset? You need to build a scrapper, design a database for the data, analyze the data like a data scientist would do and then you can start working on hypertuning those parameters! Ohh don't forget the interface. You think people would use a CLI solution?</p>
